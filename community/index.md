<h2>Major Applications</h2>

[MULTIFAN-CL](http://www.multifan-cl.org/): MULTIFAN-CL is a computer program that implements a statistical, length-based, age-structured and spatial-structured model for use in fisheries stock assessment. The model is a convergence of two previous approaches. The original MULTIFAN model (Fournier et al. 1990) provided a method of analysing time series of length-frequency data using statistical theory to provide estimates of von Bertalanffy growth parameters and the proportions-at-age in the length-frequency data. The model and associated software were developed as an analytical tool for fisheries in which large-scale age sampling of catches was infeasible or not cost effective, but where length-frequency sampling data were available. MULTIFAN provided a statistically-based, robust method of length-frequency analysis that was an alternative to several ad hoc methods being promoted in the 1980s. The Western Central Pacific Fish Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean ([WCPFC](http://wcpfc.int/)) depends on MULTIFAN-CL for assessment of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tuna stocks. MULTIFAN-CL has also been used for assessment of blue sharks, swordfish, and blue marlin in the Pacific.

[Stock Synthesis](http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/Stock_Synthesis_3.htm)
NOAA Fisheries Toolbox Version  Version 3.24f (October 2012). Stock Synthesis of SS provides a statistical framework for calibrating a population dynamics model with a diversity of fishery and survey data. The program can accommodate both age and size structure, with multiple stock sub-areas.

**trackit and kftrack/kfsst**: state-space models for reconstructing tracks produced by electronic tags. This software can be applied directly to solar irradiance time series recorded by archival tags or to position estimates produced by other algorithms. These programs have have become the methods of choice in many laboratories.

[SEAPODYM](http://www.seapodym.org/SEAPODYM-APE) is model for investigating physical-biological interaction between tuna populations and the oceanic ecosystem. Using predicted environment from ocean-biogeochemical models, SEAPODYM integrates spatio-temporal and multi-population dynamics and considers interactions among populations of different species and between populations and their physical and biological environment (including intermediate trophic levels). The model also includes a description of multiple fisheries and then predicts spatio-temporal distribution of catch catch rates, and length-frequencies of catch based either on observed or simulated fishing effort. Applications of SEAPODYM include management strategy evaluation, predicting effects of global warming, design of time-area closures. SEAPODYM-APE is a Adjoint Parameter Estimation procudure build on the AUTODIF library that estimates tuna population dynamics parameters from fisheries data.

[A-SCALA](http://iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Bulletin-Vol.-22-No-5ENG.pdf): Age-Structured Statistical Catch-at-Length Analysis used at the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission http://www.iattc.org/
for assessment of tuna stocks in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. A-SCALA is based on the MULTIFAN-CL modeling framework. A-SCALA has been used to assess tuna stocks in the eastern Pacific Ocean for the past 8 years. The species assessed include yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye tuna. A-SCALA has also been applied to bigeye tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean.

**Coleraine**: A generalized age structured stock assessment model. Coleraine has been used in several countries to assess the status of many fish stocks (e.g. US: sablefish, short spine thornyhead, ling, Pacific herring, various rockfish; Canada: albacore tuna, rock sole; New Zealand: southern blue whiting, orange roughy, smooth oreo, rig; Australia: silver trevally, jackass morwong, pink ling, redfish; Chile: lobster, shrimp; Iceland: cod). Coleraine was used to provide examples and was included as a tool in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Bayesian stock assessment user’s manual. Coleraine has been used in several university courses (e.g. the courses “Age Structured Modeling” FISH 507 and “Advanced Fisheries Stock Assessment” FISH 558
at the University of Washington. The course “Evaluacion de Stock” at the Universidad de Concepcion, Chile).

**statHBS**: A statistical version of the habitat based method to standardize catch and effort data from longline fisheries. This is a nonlinear model that has had applications that have included data sets with hundreds of thousands of data points. This model has been used by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the US National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Research Institute for far Seas Fisheries, Japan, Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean. The model has been applied to several Pacific HMS species including: bigeye and yellowfin tuna, striped marlin and blue shark. Funding has been acquired by the US National Marine Fisheries Service from the Pelagic Fisheries Research Program to develop it further.

**A generalized assessment and management strategy evaluation model for marine mammals**: This model was funded by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and was applied to the New Zealand sea lion population. Its has also been adapted to other marine mammal stocks in New Zealand (e.g. Hectors and Maui dolphin)

[Case specific models for Alaska groundfish](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/Stocks/assessments.htm)
: These age-structured models were developed from a core set of routines at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. They include assessment applications to three different stocks of Alaska pollock, Alaska-wide sablefish, eight stocks of flatfish, seven stocks of rockfish, and Atka mackerel in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Overall, these assessments are used to manage nearly two million tons of catch each year.

A Bayesian seasonal and sex-specific length-structured assessment model for the American lobster stocks: This model is developed for assessing the American lobster fishery in the northeastern United States. It is funded by the Maine Sea Grant College Program, Maine Department of Marine Resources, and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.
