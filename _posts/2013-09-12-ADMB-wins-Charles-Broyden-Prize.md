The ADMB paper ([Fournier et al. 2012](http://tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556788.2011.597854)) has been awarded the [Charles Boyden Prize](http://tandf.co.uk/journals/pdf/announcements/goms.pdf).  

The prize is awarded to the best paper published in Optimization Methods and Software each year, chosen by an international prize committee.

Congratulations to Dave Fournier and everyone who has contributed to the ADMB Project!

_(The English mathematician Charles Broyden was the ‘B’ in the BFGS nonlinear optimization algorithm.)_
