June 30, 2012 â€“ July 1, 2012

Participant fee: 1600 NOK, including full board accommodation at Finse Alpine Research Center. Limited to 25 participants.

This course targets quantitative ecologists, and students who need to handle nonlinear statistical models (both frequentist and Bayesian). AD Model Builder (admb-project.org) is highly efficient, freely available software for implementing non-linear statistical models.

This workshop may be combined with the other workshop at Finse or one of the two workshops at Sundvollen.
