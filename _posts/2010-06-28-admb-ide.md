To all ADMB users,

An integrated development environment for ADMB (ADMB-IDE) is now [available](/downloads/).  It utilizes the Emacs editor with a simplified user interface. Users can set everything up with an installer (Windows), or configure the
components by hand (Windows, Linux, Mac OS). See the manual for details.

More information and manuals can be found on [ADMB-IDE page](/community/editing-tools/admb-ide/).

For some time, users have requested an IDE for ADMB to aid in developing models.  Much thanks to Arni Magnusson for taking charge in developing this most requested feature.  Please try ADMB-IDE for developing your models.

If there are questions or issues, please email users@admb-project.org for support and help.

Enjoy,

ADMB Core Team
