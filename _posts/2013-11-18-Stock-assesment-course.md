The course includes uncertainty estimation of the relevant parameters estimated in stock assessments. It is aimed at scientists who have some foundation in the fundamentals of stock assessments. In the course we examine various assumptions as well as strength and weaknesses of different methods. The course will take you through the different steps that are part of any stock assessment.
