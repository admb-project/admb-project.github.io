The ADMB Foundation has nominated Dave Fournier for the American Fisheries Society’s William E. Ricker Resource Conservation Award. With this nomination, the Foundation is helping to give Dave the recognition he deserves for both his general contribution to fisheries stock assessment and for creation of ADMB. For more information visit the [ADMB Foundation](http://admb-foundation.org/).
 
The nomination was unsuccessful. Dr Fournier’s nomination was the runner-up and therefore he will be automatically re-nominated next year using the same material. Thanks to everyone that provided support letters. For those of you who did not provide support letters, we encourage you to send a letter next year.
