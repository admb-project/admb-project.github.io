title: ADMB anonymous source version control available 
date: 2011-04-11

Hi all,

The primary ADMB version control has been moved!  It is now located at
http://www.admb-project.org/svn/

To checkout the trunk, use the command below to anonymously checkout a read-only copy

```
svn checkout http://www.admb-project.org/svn/trunk admb-trunk-read-only
```

For Tortoise svn users, use the url above to checkout code.

After checking out a copy, read the [README.txt](http://www.admb-project.org/svn/trunk/README.txt) in the trunk for procedures to build ADMB.

The previous version control (shibi) is now read-only accessible.  The last revision is 1006.  The new primary version control was imported only with the trunk at 1006.  Past versions will require accessing the previous version control.

For those that need **write access**, please email users@admb-project.org to request an account.  The Core ADMB developer’s accounts are being transferred to the new version control.  To checkout code with write access use:

```
svn checkout svn+ssh://www.admb-project.org/trunk admb-trunk
```

The configure script will need to be build using the commands below

```
>cd admb-trunk
>make –directory=scripts/configure
>./configure
>make
>make install
```

For help or questions, please email users@admb-project.org.

Lastly, I would like to thank Arni Magnusson and Ben Bolker for their persistence.

Yes, you can stop hitting me with the hammer now…

Thank you so much for your patience.

Cheers,

Johnoel
