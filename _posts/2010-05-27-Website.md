The ADMB project main website at http://www.admb-project.org/ has a new and nicer eye candy look.  We would like to thank [Fusion Creative](http://fusioncreative.ca/) for designing the cool logo and the graphics.  The ADMB logo just rocks.  I canâ€™t wait to put it on a baseball hat.  Also, we would like to thank the folks at [SOEST Publications](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PubServices/Publications.html) for designing and creating the layout.  The website uses [Plone](http://plone.org/) which is a open source content management system.  Finally, kudos to all the ADMB users who offered input into the redesign.

If there are any question or comments, please email users@admb-project.org.

Happy Holidays,  
The ADMB Core Developers
