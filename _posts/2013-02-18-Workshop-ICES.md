Workshop dates: February 18, 2013 â€“ February 22, 2013

This will be an advanced course in fisheries stock assessment modelling. The course will guide the participants through families of stock assessment models, explaining the key differences between deterministic procedures, stochastic models, Bayesian models, and state-space models.  

The goal is to enable participants to:  

* Build assessment models in AD Model Builder (ADMB)
* Modify existing ADMB models
