Hi all,  

The ADMB-11.4 release is now freely available.   
Read ‘CHANGES‘ for a list of bug fixes, improvements and new features.  
Read ‘INSTALL‘ procedures to install from source and binary distributions.  

This quick release fixes a problem reported by Steve Martell with building shared libraries for admb and random effects models.  

Follow the unix commands below to build a admb random effects shared library:  

``` 
examples/admb-re/orange$ admb -d orange
``` 

Use -d option to build shared library,
then follow the commands to use the shared library in R:

```
> dyn.load(“orange.so”)
> ret <- .C(“orange”, “”)
> dyn.unload(“orange.so”)
```

Check [ADMB-11.4 downloads](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/releases/tag/admb-11.4) for source and binary distributions. Email any feedback to **users@admb-project.org**.  

Cheers,  
ADMB Core Team
