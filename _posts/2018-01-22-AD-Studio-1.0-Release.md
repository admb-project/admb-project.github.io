Dear ADMB/TMB developers and users,

I have just released AD Studio 1.0, the next generation of ADMB-IDE and
TMB-IDE, combined in one!

Main features:

- Dedicated environment for developing ADMB and TMB models
- Uses the C++ compiler from Rtools
- Based on the Emacs editor, but with simplified keybindings
- Especially good support for R, LaTeX, Markdown, GDB, and Git
- Flexible layout to arrange multiple files on screen

It includes the newest version of all components (ADMB 12.0, Emacs 25.3,
Rtools 3.4, etc.) and should fit well on a machine that already has a
combination of R, TMB, Rtools, RStudio, and so on. Your feedback is
appreciated.

Download information and user manual can be found on the AD Studio website:

All the best,

Arni
