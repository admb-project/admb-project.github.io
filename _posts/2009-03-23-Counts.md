The ADMB libraries have been downloaded more than 2000 times since they were posted in December 2008. The most popular download has consistently been the ADMB 9.0 windows 32-bit binaries for MinGW gcc-3.4.5. The most popular download for linux has been the 32-bit libraries for gcc 4.10. For details see the [ADMB project download page](http://code.google.com/p/admb-project/downloads/list).
 
ADMB Project managers expect to provide new automated Windows installers soon, and a beta version of the source code will also be available in the next month.
