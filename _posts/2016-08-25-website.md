Hi all,

The [ADMB Project main website](http://www.admb-project.org/) has moved and is now hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

GitHub pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to automatically transfrom template pages and 
markdown files into html.

**Changes:**

* Simplified and improved theme using R-Project stylesheets.
* Simplified and improved menus for easily locating information.
* Relinked bibliography, community files and older tutorials.
* Pages are stored in github repository. <br/> https://github.com/admb-project/admb-project.github.io/
* Much easier to edit files online using markdown syntax.
* Lots of fixes to broken urls.

More changes are still underway for the website.

Please continue to check and provide feedback to **users@admb-project.org**.

Cheers,

ADMB Core Team
