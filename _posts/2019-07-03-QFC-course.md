title: QFC Course - Software Tools for Maximum Likelihood Estimation
date: 2019-07-02
---

The course, taught by Dr. Jim Bence, will cover both AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB). These are two modern software tools for computationally efficient fitting of nonlinear and non-normal statistical models by maximum likelihood using the Laplace Approximation. TMB is particularly useful for models with random effects, including state space models. These software packages are widely used in fishery stock assessments.

Course Dates and Meeting Times
------------------------------

The course will run from July 15, 2019 to October 8,  2019.  This course is a mix of asynchronous work and synchronous meetings through videoconference.  Synchronous meetings occur once every two weeks through September 24.

Technology requirements
-----------------------

The course will be taught using R Studio, R, and AD Studio.  This software is all freely available and instructions for installation are given in the class.
