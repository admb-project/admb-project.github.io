**ICES training course in Stock assessment (Advanced). Copenhagen, 18 â€“ 22 November 2013**

This is an advanced course in fisheries stock assessment modelling where we explore generic properties of stock assessment methods. The course includes uncertainty estimation of the relevant parameters estimated in stock assessments. It is aimed at scientists who have some foundation in the fundamentals of stock assessments.

The five-day course is organized as a series of sessions with alternating focus on theoretical concepts and hands-on work on examples. These example sessions will be completed in different software environments such as R and ADMB (see flr-project.org and admb-project.org)
