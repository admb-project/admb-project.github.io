This introductory workshop will help familiarize participants with approaches to model development in TMB. Contrasts with ADMB will be covered, though participants are not required to be proficient in ADMB. Participants are assumed to have a background in applied statistics and statistical computing. Specifically, some experience fitting nonlinear models to data (in stock assessment or elsewhere) and basic programming skills.
