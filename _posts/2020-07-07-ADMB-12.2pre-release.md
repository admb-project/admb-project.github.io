Hi all,  

The ADMB-12.2pre minor release is now freely available for testing.


Read [CHANGES](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/blob/admb-12.2pre/CHANGES.md) for a list of bug fixes, improvements and new features.  


Read [INSTALL](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/blob/admb-12.2pre/INSTALL.md) procedures to install from source and binary distributions.  


Check [ADMB-12.2pre downloads](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/releases/tag/admb-12.2pre) for source only distributions.  


ADMB-12.2 will be released about a week or two later after testing and feedback.
