title: Bug Fixes for ADMB 11.0 
date: 2012-07-06
---

After user feedback about speed and accuracy in ADMB 11.0, source code relating to the beta and gamma distributions, LU decomposition, and solve(â€¦) has been reverted to the code used in ADMB 9.0. The updated code is available for testing on the ADMB Subversion server [trunk]().

The function reference guide (API or dox) is under construction. Help is welcome.
