"Emacs admb-mode without the Emacs"

The main purpose of AD Studio is to make the convenient Emacs
[Emacs](/tools/editors/emacs/) features of admb-mode and tmb-mode available to
non-Emacs users. In other words, to disable the standard Emacs behavior.

Experienced Emacs users may prefer to ignore the AD Studio .emacs file, and
simply install and load ADMB Mode ([admb.el](/tools/editors/emacs/admb.el)) and
TMB Mode ([tmb.el](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/blob/master/emacs/tmb.el))
like other Emacs packages. They are written as standard "major modes'' that
follow all Emacs mode conventions.
