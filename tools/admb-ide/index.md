## ADMB-IDE

Please note that [**AD Studio**](https://github.com/admb-project/adstudio) is
the successor of both ADMB-IDE and TMB-IDE. It provides all the functionality of
the earlier ADMB-IDE and more.

The old [ADMB-IDE 11.2](download.html) release from 2015 is still available,
along with the user [manual](admb-ide.pdf).
