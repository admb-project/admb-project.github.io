<h2>Readme</h2>

The main purpose of ADMB-IDE is to make the convenient features of
[Emacs](/tools/editors/emacs/) admb-mode available to non-Emacs users. In other
words, to disable the standard Emacs behavior.

Experienced Emacs users may prefer to ignore the ADMB-IDE .emacs file, and
simply install and load
[admb.el](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/blob/master/contrib/emacs/admb.el)
like other Emacs packages. It is a standard "major mode'' that follows all Emacs
mode conventions.
