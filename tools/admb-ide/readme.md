"Emacs admb-mode without the Emacs"
The purpose of ADMB-IDE is to make the convenient features of [Emacs](http://www.admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs) admb-mode available to non-Emacs users. In other words, to disable the standard Emacs behavior.

Experienced Emacs users may prefer to ignore the ADMB-IDE .emacs file, and simply install and load [admb.el](/tools/editors/emacs/admb.el) like other Emacs packages. It is a standard "major mode'' that follows all Emacs mode conventions.
