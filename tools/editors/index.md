TextMate Bundle
: This file enables useful highlighting and templates in TextMate. It also includes templates for running ADMB via the R package R2admb.

Tinn-R
: Tinn-R is free, simple but efficient text editor. It is appears to be intended as a replacement for the basic code editor provided by Rgui, so it should be a tool to introduce R users to ADMB.
