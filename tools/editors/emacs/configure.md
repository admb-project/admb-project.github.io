Advanced Emacs configuration

**The .emacs file**
General information about the .emacs file is provided in the [Install](install.html) notes and sections of the [Emacs manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html), [Emacs Lisp manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Init-File.html), [Chassel's tutorial](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/html_node/Emacs-Initialization.html), and [EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile).

**The Emacs Lisp language**
The built-in help system in Emacs provides on-the-fly help pages on functions (C-h f), variables (C-h v), and other Emacs Lisp concepts. See C-h C-h for an overview of the help system.

The hefty PDF versions of the [Emacs manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/emacs.pdf), [Emacs Lisp manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/elisp.pdf), and [Chassel's tutorial](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/emacs-lisp-intro.pdf) describe the Emacs Lisp language in great detail. Download them and use as an overview and reference when something is confusing.

**Examples**
Perhaps the best way to make your Emacs working environment more efficient is to borrow ideas and code from other users. A web search for "dot emacs" or "my emacs" returns many examples. Here are links to mine:

[.emacs](http://www.hafro.is/~arnima/.emacs)

[.emacs-linux.el](http://www.hafro.is/~arnima/.emacs-linux.el)

[.emacs-windows.el](http://www.hafro.is/~arnima/.emacs-windows.el)

Note that they're machine-specific, so you need to adapt to your machine and personal preferences.

[ADMB-IDE](/tools/admb-ide/) comes with a .emacs configuration file that has some unusual settings worth checking out.
