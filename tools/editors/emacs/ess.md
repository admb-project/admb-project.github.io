Emacs modes for R/S-Plus, SAS, BUGS/JAGS, Stata, and XLisp-Stat

The [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/) (Emacs Speaks Statistics) website provides [downloads](http://ess.r-project.org/downloads/ess/) and [installation](http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#Installation) instructions.

Users can run statistical programs like R inside Emacs, or simply edit source code (functions and help pages) with syntax highlighting and indentation.

AD Studio comes with ESS.
