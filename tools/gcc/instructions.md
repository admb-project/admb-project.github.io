Instructions
------------

Unzip to a place like c:/gnu/gcc and set the PATH accordingly. Use the -m64 compiler option to build 64-bit applications when working with a combined 32- and 64-bit compiler (gcc*-win3264.zip).

If you don't know how to set the PATH, some steps are listed on the page [ADMB Installation Windows GCC](/docs/user-contributed-tutorials/admb-installation-mingw.html).
