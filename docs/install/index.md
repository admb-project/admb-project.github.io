Installation

**AD Studio**

The easiest way to start using ADMB in Windows is to install [AD Studio](https://github.com/admb-project/adstudio), which sets up ADMB with an editor, compiler, and debugger.
Read no further if AD Studio suits your needs.

**Downloading**
Precompiled binaries and the source distribution can be downloaded from the [downloads](/downloads/) tab of this website.  Installation instructions are also in the downloads tab.

If you have problems with installation, please write to users@admb-project.org with information about your operating system, the version of ADMB you're trying to install, and what error messages or other problems you had.
