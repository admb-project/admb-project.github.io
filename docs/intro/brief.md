ADMB on one page

**ADMB is fast**

The [NCEAS benchmark](/developers/benchmarks/optimization/nceas.pdf) shows that ADMB outperforms R and BUGS by a wide margin, when fitting a variety of non-trivial models.

Try it out
ADMB is free software.

The easiest way to start using ADMB in Windows is to install [ADMB-IDE](http://code.google.com/p/admb-project/downloads/list?&q=admb-ide), which sets up ADMB with an editor, compiler, and debugger.

Linux and Mac users can download the [source code](http://code.google.com/p/admb-project/downloads/list?can=2&q=source) and build ADMB from source, following the instructions included.

**Build and run your first model**

After installing ADMB, navigate to the ‘examples’ directory (by default, c:/admb/examples in Windows) and copy the ‘simple’ example to a working directory, such as c:/test/simple.

If you have ADMB-IDE installed, double-click ‘simple.tpl’, go to the ADMB menu and select Build. Wait for the compiler to build the model and then select Run and View Point Estimates.

Alternatively, open a shell and run admb simple to build the model and type simple to run the model. Then open ‘simple.par’ in a text editor to view the point estimates.

**Next steps**

Skim through the [manuals](/docs/manuals/), [reference cards](/docs/refcards/), and [papers](/docs/papers/) describing how ADMB works.

View the [training videos](ftp://glpd.fw.msu.edu/QFC/ADMB-Videos/Current_ADMB_Video_Release/), attend an upcoming [course](/courses/), or study material from [previous](/courses/previous/) courses.

Run and modify the [examples](https://github.com/admb-project/examples) that come with ADMB, download more examples from the ADMB website or elsewhere.

Write a small model related to your research.
