#  Obsolete benchmark (1998/2006)

ADMB vs. Gauss vs. Matlab vs. R/S-Plus

Summary written by Arni Magnusson, 16 June 2010

Schnute et al. (1998) published a benchmark comparing the performance of different optimization software. They tested ADMB, Gauss, Matlab, and S-Plus with a catch-at-age model by Schnute and Richards (1995), using datasets simulated with S-Plus.

The simulated datasets included _T_ years of data and _A_ age classes, resulting in _m_=_T_ _A_ 5 estimated parameters. The computer had a 133 MHz processor and 48 MB RAM, running Windows NT 4.0.

 

**Benchmark trials for two cases of a catch-at-age model, in which _T_ years of data are available for _A_ age classes and the total number of parameters is _m_=_T_ _A_ 5.**

S-Plus exhausted the computer memory before finishing the calculations, and in smaller examples where evaluations were obtained, S-Plus was much slower than the other products.

ADMB performed much faster and required fewer function calls than its competitors in this benchmark. The reduced number of function calls stems directly from automatic differentiation. One call in ADMB evaluates both the function and its gradient. The other products approximate gradients by making a small change to each estimated parameter, requiring _m_ 1 function calls to achieve the same result. Furthermore, ADMB obtains gradients accurate to machine precision, instead of approximations.

Case 2 scales the problem by a factor of 100/37=2.7, but the computation time increases by a greater factor. ADMB appears more scalable than the other products, probably from the efficiencies of reverse automatic differentiation.

**Update**

In Nov 2006, Dave Fournier ported the S-Plus model to R and benchmarked it against ADMB on newer hardware. With _T_=80 years and _A_=15 ages, the updated benchmark corresponds to Case 2 in the original benchmark:

 

 

|  Product |  ms/call  
 |  Calls  
 |  Time  

 |  Function value  
 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
|  ADMB  
 |  10.79  
 |  278  
 |  3 s  
 |  3718.693119  
 |
|  R  
 |  33.17  
 |  56,074  
 |  31 min  
 |  3717.469  
 |
|  R  
 |  33.81  
 |  165,000  
 |  93 min  
 |  3718.693119  
 |

 

 

In the first run, R was manually interrupted after 31 minutes, to check the function value and parameter estimates. The function value was still far from the optimal value, and one parameter, gamma, was at 0.61, far from the optimal value of 0.42.

In the other run, R was allowed to converge. This took 93 minutes, more than 1000 times longer than ADMB.
