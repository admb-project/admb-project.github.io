:  Jim Regetz, Mark Schildhauer and colleagues at NCEAS have created a very nice introductory guide to ADMB. Jim is looking for feedback and some really good example applications that would attract ecologists to ADMB.

[Statistical models for population reconstruction using age-at-harvest data][14]
:  Gove et al 2002 Journal of Wildlife Managment 66(2):310-320. Is this a good example to attract ecologists to ADMB?
